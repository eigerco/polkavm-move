# Move Language support in PolkaVM

Move is a statically-typed programming language designed for safe and flexible smart contract development, with a strong focus on digital asset management.
It uses a resource-oriented model that enforces ownership and prevents assets from being accidentally copied or lost, making it ideal for secure blockchain applications.
Move was originally developed at Facebook.

PolkaVM is a lightweight virtual machine designed to execute smart contracts within the Substrate-based Polkadot ecosystem.
It serves as the execution layer for runtime logic and smart contracts on parachains, enabling decentralized applications while maintaining interoperability, security, and upgradeability across the Polkadot network.

This project adds support to execute smart contracts written in Move on PolkaVM.

## Getting started

This project relies heavily on [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) and just requires installing the necessary developer tools.

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt install libpolly-19-dev lld-19 zstd libzstd-dev llvm-19 llvm-19-dev clang-19
```

```bash
# Fedora
dnf install llvm-devel
```

```bash
# MacOS
brew install llvm lld
```

Even though LLVM itself is written in C++, we use Rust, especially [llvm-sys](https://crates.io/crates/llvm-sys).

Install Rust:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Build the `move-to-polka` tool:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Architecture

On a high level, we use a stackless version of Move byte-code and compile it down to RISC-V machine instructions.
Then, we use the PolkaVM linker to convert the ELF file into a PolkaVM file.
These steps all happen offline.

### Details

We first fetch all git dependencies of the Move project described in the Move.toml file.
Then, we compile the sources of your Move project with the specified dependencies, first to move bytecode, then
to move stackless bytecode, then to LLVM IR, then use the LLVM backend to emit RISC-V object files. These are
then combined and then linked to a .polkavm file using the `polkatool` linker.

We assume the Move project will have one module with at least one `entry` function, and that no other module
contains `entry` functions (to avoid duplicate symbols in the executable). We further assume this `entry` function
takes a single argument, namely a Move Signer.

If the Move project does not include an entry function, the user must manually add one. This entry function serves
a similar role to scripts in the traditional Move language: it acts as the executable entry point for invoking
module functionality. However, since the Polkadot Virtual Machine (PVM) does not support a scripting mechanism akin
to Move's, we simulate this behavior by requiring an entry function within the module itself. This approach allows
us to provide a deterministic entry point for the contract, enabling the generated call_selector to dispatch the
appropriate logic during execution on PVM.

In our system, the Move Signer is mapped directly to the account that signs the extrinsic in the Polkadot
environment. This mapping is crucial because access control within the simulated global storage—implemented in the
`pallet_revive` module—is tightly coupled to the identity of the signer. Each signer has exclusive access to
specific portions of the global storage corresponding to their account, which mirrors the Move model where a Signer
can only manipulate resources under their own address. By enforcing this constraint, we ensure that the behavior of
smart contracts remains consistent with Move’s ownership and security semantics, while leveraging the Polkadot
execution context.

Pallet-revive expects the .polkavm files to have 2 exports: `deploy`
and `call`. These are generated during translation. The `call` function calls a `call_selector` function that
will contain a switch to call any `entry` function of the module, based on the keccak hash of the function name.
The owner account of the smart contract (the user that uploaded the code) is found using the `origin()` syscall.
This returns a H160, and we transform it into the 32 byte AccountId. This is passed to the chosen `entry` function
as signer argument (thus mapping the Polkadot AccountId one to one with a Move signer address).

### Pallet-revive integration

We have implemented the following syscalls in pallet-revive:

```rust
// Move syscalls
fn debug_print(ptr_to_type: u32, address_ptr: u32);
fn exists(address_ptr: u32, ptr_to_tag: u32) -> u32;
fn move_to(ptr_to_signer: u32, ptr_to_struct: u32, ptr_to_tag: u32) -> u32;
fn move_from(address_ptr: u32, remove: u32, ptr_to_tag: u32, is_mut: u32) -> u32;
fn release(ptr_to_signer: u32, ptr_to_struct: u32, ptr_to_tag: u32);
fn hash_hash2_256(ptr_to_buf: u32) -> u32;
fn hash_hash3_256(ptr_to_buf: u32) -> u32;
```

Furthermore, we hooked up the Move `abort` syscall to the pallet-revive `terminate` syscall.

### Global Storage

Move global storage is implemented as pallet storage. See `polkadot-sdk/substrate/frame/revive/src/move_storage.rs`.

## Basic usage

The main crates for this repo are:

- `move-to-polka` crate, which is the actual Move to PolkaVM compiler

### `move-to-polka` installation and usage

Install `move-to-polka` binary:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/move-to-polka
```

Compile the given move project (should contain Move.toml) into a PolkaVM module (`output/output.polkavm` by default):

```bash
move-to-polka examples/storage
```

## Running on pallet-revive
In this tutorial, we'll walk through compiling a simple Move module, deploying it to a local Polkadot node running the pallet-revive runtime, and executing a transaction that interacts with Move-based logic on-chain. By the end of the guide, you'll see how Move contracts compiled to RISC-V can be instantiated and executed inside the Polkadot ecosystem using PolkaVM.

We’ll use a sample Move module that writes a value into global storage and then call it using a manually constructed selector. The purpose is to demonstrate the full flow—from compilation to contract execution—using our custom runtime.

- First run all the tests in [polkavm-move](https://github.com/eigerco/polkavm-move) repo (this generates all the .polkavm files). We'll use the `storage` example, which is a simple Move module that interacts with global storage.
- Clone our fork of [polkadot-sdk](https://github.com/eigerco/polkadot-sdk).
- Run the node from within the clone: `RUST_LOG="error,sc_rpc_server=info,runtime::revive=debug" cargo run --release --bin substrate-node -- --dev`
- Log in to the Web GUI at https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/explorer
- Go to the Extrinsics, choose 'revive'.
- Choose `instantiateWithCode`, with following settings
  - value: 12345
  - gasLimit refTime: 1000000000000
  - gasLimit proofSize: 500000
  - storageDepositLimit: 12345678901234567890
  - code (choose the crates/move-to-polka/output/storage/storage.polkavm file)
  - data: 0xfa1e1f30 (see [How to find the call selector](#how_to_find_the_call_selector))
- Check the logs for the H160 of the uploaded contract. Logs can be found in the Block Explorer - search for the event `revive.instantiate` and get it details to read the contract address.
- Choose 'call', fill in the H160 address of the contract, use same settings for the rest
- Observe the logs in the console (where you run the node), see that the code is called. Output should look like this:

```

This means that the Move logic was executed, and smart contract is interacting with the global storage using borrow/release mechanisms known from the original Move language.

What Just Happened? To summarize:
- You compiled Move source code into a PolkaVM-compatible binary. 
- You deployed this binary to a local Substrate node using pallet-revive. 
- You invoked the compiled and translated Move logic by submitting an extrinsic. 
- The contract used the signer's identity (from the extrinsic) to determine access to global storage. 
- You saw confirmation in the logs that the logic executed correctly.
This flow allows you to write logic in Move, compile it to RISC-V, and run it deterministically on-chain inside the Polkadot ecosystem—without needing a Move VM.

Feel free to experiment with other Move modules, compile them using `move-to-polka`, and deploy them to your local node using the same steps. You can also modify the `storage` example to add more complex logic or additional modules, and see how they interact with global storage and each other.

### How to find the call selector

To call module::function (in the example below storage::store_then_borrow), take the first 4 bytes (8 hex chars) of the keccak 256 hash
of the module::function name.

```bash
echo -n 'storage::store_then_borrow' | keccak-256sum | cut -c -8
fa1e1f30
```

## Known limitations:

Compiled Move code is not allowed to call external modules at runtime—this is not strictly a limitation, but rather an intentional architectural decision aimed at preserving both performance and safety.

While the Move language conceptually supports storing modules in global storage and invoking them dynamically, replicating this behavior in the Polkadot Virtual Machine (PVM) environment would introduce significant overhead. For example, storing external modules in `pallet_revive` and accessing them during execution would not only be computationally expensive but also undermine the predictability and verifiability of the system. Instead, we require that all module dependencies be statically compiled into the output blob at build time. This design allows the compiler to perform all necessary checks and validations ahead of execution, ensuring type safety, access control, and integrity of the logic. Since PVM operates on compiled RISC-V binaries rather than Move bytecode, it cannot enforce the same runtime guarantees as the Move Virtual Machine. As such, any interaction with other code must occur via dependencies that are explicitly included and verified during compilation, ensuring that all code executed on-chain has been fully validated and integrated into the contract binary beforehand.

In the future, this design could be extended to support calling code that has been uploaded by other users into Global Storage. Since the Move language does not support calling external contracts through any means other than accessing modules stored in global storage, any such interaction would naturally be limited to code deployed and accessible in that context. This means that translated Move programs, by design, cannot directly interact with other PolkaVM blobs stored outside of pallet_revive. However, because we have extended pallet_revive to support Global Storage access via host calls—where a program can specify the signer whose storage it wants to write-access — translated Move programs can already exchange data with external contracts in a controlled manner. This capability lays the groundwork for future support of inter-contract calls between Move-based contracts.

## Troubleshooting

If you get an error related to

```
error: No suitable version of LLVM was found system-wide or pointed
              to by LLVM_SYS_191_PREFIX
```

Try using

```bash
export LLVM_SYS_191_PREFIX="/usr/local/opt/llvm@19"
```

or

```bash
export LLVM_SYS_191_PREFIX=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/llvm/20.1.8/
```

Depending on your distribution, you may need to set the following kernel parameters:

```
sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0
sudo sysctl -w vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd=1
```
